#  BetterBreath


## Why?

Because the Apple Watch breathing app is not very flexible. Also the apps that are flexible, don't support watches or breathing by vibration.
Breathing following the vibration is possible without headphones and without awkwardly looking at the screen. You only need your phone and no accessories.

Good old non-digital meditation bands also offer this tacticle feedback where you go through each bead feeling them with your fingers. 

## Implemented

- Adding breath exercises
- Deleting breath exercises
- Breath in, breath out, full hold, empty hold tuning
- Starting an exercise
- An animated circle to follow with your breath
- Timer for breath screen
- A duration after which the exercise ends
- Play a sound when at the end of exercise

## TODO

- Phone vibration that guides the breathing
- Add a 3 sec countdown before the breath exercise starts 
- Apple watch support
- Modifying existing breath exercise
- Theming
- More fanfare when finishing meditation
- Keeping track of total meditation stats
- Heart rate and HRV tracking during practice
