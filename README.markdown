#  BetterBreath


## Why?

Because the Apple Watch breathing app is not very flexible. Also the apps that are flexible, don't support watches or breathing by vibration.
Breathing following the vibration is possible without headphones and without awkwardly looking at the screen. You only need your phone and no accessories.

Good old non-digital meditation bands also offer this tactile feedback where you go through each bead feeling them with your fingers. 

## Implemented

- Adding breath exercises
- Deleting breath exercises
- Breath in, breath out, full hold, empty hold tuning
- Starting an exercise
- An animated circle to follow with your breath
- Timer for breath screen
- A duration after which the exercise ends
- Play a sound when at the end of exercise
- Play in and out breath sound to guide breathing
- mute/enable sound
- UI improvements
    - Add headers to customize breath screen "In breath", "out breath"

## TODO

- continue/Pause
- Phone vibration that guides the breathing
- Create a navigation/routing layer
- Add a 3 sec countdown before the breath exercise starts 
- Apple watch support
- Modifying existing breath exercise
- Theming
- More fanfare when finishing meditation
- Keeping track of total meditation stats
- Heart rate and HRV tracking during practice

## Logic for breath audio

### First simple logic
- Just stretch in breath and out breath audio to the duration of the in and out breath


### Fancier logic

- Have a choir sound generated by AI prompt "A serene asexual choir takes a single deep breath in and out" from Eleven Labs.

- Split in breath voice into 3 parts. Start of taking in breath, maintaining in breath, and ending in breath.
 - Maintain breath should be loop able
 - In breath should transition smoothly to maintain
 - Maintain should transition smoothly to out breath
- Play first part of sound when in breath starts, then loop maintaining sound as much as necessary, finally end with out breath sound
- A breath in OR out can be anywhere between 1 to 60 seconds alone
- If breath is less than the default duration of the different breath parts it should play them quickly
- Should have maximum duration for in/out breath transition in and out durations
