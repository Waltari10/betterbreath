#  BetterBreath


## Why?

Because the Apple Watch breathing app is not very flexible. Also the flexible apps don't usually support watches or breathing by vibration.

## Implemented

- Adding breath exercises
- Deleting breath exercises
- Breath in, breath out, full hold, empty hold tuning
- Starting an exercise
- An animated circle to follow with your breath
- Timer for breath screen

## TODO

- Add a 3 sec countdown before the breath exercise starts 
- Phone vibration that guides the breathing
- Apple watch support
- A duration after which the exercise ends
- Modifying existing breath exercise
- Theming
- Play a sound when at the end of exercise
